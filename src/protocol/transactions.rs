/// Submit a transaction to the network
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// * `node` - The node to submit the transaction to
/// * `sender` - The account sending the transaction
/// * `signer` - The signing key for the sender
/// * `receiver` - The account address for which the transaction is intended
/// * `amount` - The amount to send
/// * `register_completion_callback` - Whether to register a callback to receive a proof of the transaction when it is incorporated into a block
///     
/// # Returns
/// * `Ok(Some(receiver))` - If the transaction was acknowledged and a callback was registered
/// * `Ok(None)` - If the transaction was acknowledged but no callback was registered
/// * `Err(e)` - If the transaction was not acknowledged or an error occurred
